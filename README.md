## industry tools for soc and siem
1. Data dog:Datadog’s more than 450 integrations let you collect metrics, logs, and traces from your entire stack as well as from your security tools, giving you end-to-end visibility into your environment. This lets you cast a wider net to catch possible security issues, and provides deeper context during your investigations. For example, if you detect abnormally high CPU utilization on a host, you can pinpoint which container or process is causing it to determine if you’re dealing with a crypto-miner.Datadog’s log processing pipelines automatically parse out key standard attributes from your ingested logs and events, unifying your logs across teams and data sources. This makes it easy to search and filter log data across your entire infrastructure for threat detection and investigation.

Log processing pipelines also enrich ingested logs and events with dynamic context that improves threat detection accuracy. For example, the geoip processor identifies the country and city of an IP, allowing you to detect anomalies in authentication patterns. The lookup processor lets you enrich events with your own business data to answer questions such as: have we blacklisted this IP? Does this MAC address belong to a stolen laptop?
